Title: Effects of Overexpressing the WRKY Type Transcription Factor OsWRKY28 on Rice Leaves 48 Hours After Infection with Magnaporthe Oryzae
Organism: Oryza sativa
Experiment Type: Expression profiling by array

Summary: This study involves the analysis of transgenic rice that overexpresses OsWRKY28, a WRKY type transcription factor. The results provide insights into the role of OsWRKY28 in defense signaling against the rice blast fungus.
Overall Design: Expression profiling was conducted in wild-type and OsWRKY28 overexpressing rice leaves infected with or without Magnaporthe Oryzae, using a one-color method with three biological replicates.
